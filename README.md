# Inertia.js Tables for Laravel Query Builder

This package provides a DataTables-like experience for Inertia.js with support for searching, filtering, sorting, toggling columns, and pagination. It generates URLs that can be consumed by Spatie's excellent Laravel Query Builder package, with no additional logic needed. The components are styled with Tailwind CSS 3.0, but it's fully customizable with slots. The data refresh logic is based on Inertia's Ping CRM demo.
